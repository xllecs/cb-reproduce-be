# About this project

This is an attempt to build a replica of the Cole Buxton online store which I am a fan of (not finished yet).

The project here represents the backend part built with Django. Here is where I have:
- Exposed the GraphQL schema with its types, queries and mutations using graphene.
- Made the communication between the frontend and backend possible through corsheaders.
- Created the models, tables and migrations in PostgreSQL.
- Implemented JWT authentication to handle the login/register logic in the frontend.

**DISCLAIMER: THE PROJECT WAS BUILT ONLY FOR LEARNING PURPOSES AND IT IS NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, GOING TO BE USED FOR COMMERCIAL USE.**
